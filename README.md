This is my Curriculum Vitae (CV)
================================
This repository is used for developing my CV in Tex.
Anyone who likes the template can use it.

Sections

The sections can be put at any way you want just by changing the order in the cv.tex.

The sections are:
- Info
- About
- Education
- Work Experience
- Skills (for hard Skills)
- Soft Skills
- Familiar with (for technologies or subjects you are familiar with)

Notes

1. The Macros folder includes the macros.tex file that is used to configure the look of each section.
