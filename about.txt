I am a Computer Engineer with a strong foundation in C/C++ development and a passion for creating innovative software solutions. 
With a background in electronics assembly, R&D, and audio engineering, I've honed my problem-solving skills across various technical domains. 
Currently, I am seeking to transition into a career focused on software development, particularly in C++ and related technologies.

At SmartMoto Electronics, I gained valuable experience in both hardware and software development, where I not only assembled complex electronic systems 
but also developed programs to automate tasks and prototype new products. This hands-on experience has given me a unique perspective on how software interacts with hardware, 
making me a versatile developer with a holistic understanding of engineering challenges.

My work in audio engineering and TV station operations has further sharpened my technical skills, particularly in system improvement and maintenance. 
These roles have also taught me the importance of attention to detail and the ability to adapt quickly to new challenges.

As I complete my dissertation in Computer Engineering at the University of Patras, I am eager to leverage my skills in C++, Python, and other programming languages, 
my knowledge in Linux OS and Bash scripting and my passion for Embeded systems to contribute to cutting-edge software development projects. 
I am excited to pivot my career towards roles that allow me to focus on programming and software engineering, 
where I can continue to grow and make a significant impact.
